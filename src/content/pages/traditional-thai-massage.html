                <p>Experience the ancient healing art of Traditional Thai Body Massage, known as "Nuad Phaen Bhoran" in Thai, at True Thai Therapy in Edinburgh. Often called "lazy man's yoga," this unique form of bodywork combines assisted stretching and pressure point therapy to balance your body's energy systems and promote overall wellness.</p>
                <p>During your Thai massage session, our expert therapists will guide your body through a series of yoga-like stretches while applying precise pressure along the Sen (energy) lines. This technique aims to clear energy blockages and stimulate the flow of vital energy throughout your body. Unlike Western massage styles, Thai massage is performed on a comfortable mat, and you'll remain fully clothed in loose-fitting attire we provide.</p>
                <p>This invigorating yet deeply relaxing treatment is performed without oils, allowing our therapists to use their hands, thumbs, elbows, and even feet to apply the perfect amount of pressure. Through fluid movements and gentle manipulations, tension is released, promoting flexibility, joint mobility, and a profound sense of relaxation.</p>
