        <p>
            Welcome to True Thai Therapy, Edinburgh's premier destination for authentic Thai massage and wellness since 2009. Our journey began with a simple mission: to bring the ancient art of Thai massage to the heart of Scotland's capital, focusing on customer experience, health, and happiness.
        <p>
        <h3><span class="cs-color">Our Founder</h3>
        <p>
            True Thai was established by Nongnuch Thongkong, known affectionately as Nuch to her friends and clients. With her passion for traditional Thai healing practices and a vision to share these benefits with Edinburgh, Nuch has cultivated a sanctuary of relaxation and rejuvenation in the city's bustling South Side.                               
        </p>
        <h3><span class="cs-color">Our Expertise</h3>
        <p>
            At True Thai, we specialise in traditional Thai massage, a time-honored technique that addresses a wide range of conditions. From alleviating aches and pains to treating sports injuries, improving posture, and even aiding digestion, our treatments offer comprehensive care for body and mind. We're particularly adept at helping clients overcome stress and lethargy, restoring balance to their busy lives.
        </p>
        
        <h3><span class="cs-color">Our Philosophy</h3>

Our calm and peaceful center offers a tranquil escape from the stresses of daily life, right in the heart of Edinburgh. We maintain competitive pricing to ensure that as many people as possible can experience the remarkable effects of our health and beauty treatments.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="cs-color">Your Experience</h3>

                <p>
